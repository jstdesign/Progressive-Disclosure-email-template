Progressive Disclosure email template. WIP 1

The aim is to make a progressive disclosure email template that is ready to work in campaign monitor (using it's awesome templating system). 
In order for this to work outside of Campaign Monitor simply remove the relevant tags.
Please note that this is a WIP and whilst all efforts will be made to correct bugs, like all emails it is created as a best compromise. 

I may well roll back the inclusion of fluid images as they have been causing issues, however I would love to try and solve these. Any help is welcome. 
More generally any input or help is welcome. Please feel free to fork, borrow, add or critique any part of this. 

Many thanks to Campaign Monitor for all their support and having themselves released the code for Progressive disclosure emails, as well as contributing more generally to the development of effective emails techniques and practice.
